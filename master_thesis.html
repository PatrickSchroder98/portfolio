            <h2>Development of a program for numerical solving Maxwell Equations for electromagnetic field of metal exposed to high power laser beam in the vacuum-metal system.</h2>
            <p>The aim of the diploma thesis was to present the change in the electromagnetic field connected to a high-intensity pulsed laser. To calculate changes in the dynamics of electromagnetic fields, Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions for electric and magnetic fields at the metal-vacuum boundary were used. The calculation was made in the representation of the vector potential A for the s and p polarization of the incident laser light beam. The calculations were performed using a program written in the Python. The results are presented in graphs using an interface generated using the Qt graphics package. The work focuses on presenting the method of solving Maxwell's equations for s and p polarizations. The functional specification of the application and solutions regarding technical issues of the program are described. The section devoted to the results shows graphs exhibiting the attenuation of the wave potential vector and its amplitude for both polarizations. Statistics on the technical implementation of the program are also presented. The user manual allows to learn the correct way to use the program.</p>
